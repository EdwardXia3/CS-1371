1. I chose the snake project because I wanted to understand conceptually 
how a simple game could be made.
2. I solved to problem by creating a array that represented components of the
snake and plotted that array with colors to represent the snake and the food.
Since the previously done code related to Snake suggested the array and plotting,
I just based it off that.
3. I learned how to use parts of of uicontrol, how to create simple animations, 
and the concept of the KeyPressFcn.
